Injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability that allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a system, which can be executed as a result. They can occur in various forms, including SQL injection, command injection, and script injection.

## SQL Injection

SQL injection is a type of injection attack that occurs when malicious code is injected into a SQL statement. This can allow an attacker to access or modify sensitive data in a database, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions.

To prevent SQL injection attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize user input before using it in a SQL statement. This can be done through the use of parameterized queries, input validation, and other security measures.

## Command Injection

Command injection is a type of injection attack that occurs when malicious code is injected into a system command. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions.

To prevent command injection attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize user input before using it in a system command. This can be done through the use of input validation, limiting the permissions of the user executing the command, and other security measures.

## Script Injection

Script injection is a type of injection attack that occurs when malicious code is injected into a script. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions.

To prevent script injection attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize user input before using it in a script. This can be done through the use of input validation, limiting the permissions of the user executing the script, and other security measures.

It is crucial to be vigilant and proactive in preventing injection attacks. By implementing proper validation and sanitization techniques, you can help protect your systems and sensitive data from malicious actors.
